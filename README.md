# DataViews App

## Features

- Displays a set of cards using `GridView`
- Displays the same information in a table format using `DataTable`
- Uses `InkWell` to add a splash effect when the user taps on the cards
- Customizes the primary and accent colors of the app using `ThemeData`
- Adds a shadow and round the corners to the cards using `Card`
- Adds icons to the cards using `Icon`
